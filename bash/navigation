## BETTER DIRECTORY NAVIGATION ##

# Prepend cd to directory names automatically
# NEED BASH 4+
# shopt -s autocd

# Correct spelling errors during tab-completion
# NEED BASH 4+
# shopt -s dirspell

# Correct spelling errors in arguments supplied to cd
shopt -s cdspell

# This defines where cd looks for targets
# Add the directories you want to have fast access to, separated by colon
# Ex: CDPATH=".:~:~/projects" will look for targets in the current working directory, in home and in the ~/projects folder
CDPATH=`ls -d -1 ~/Work/** | tr '\n' ':'`

# This allows you to bookmark your favorite places across the file system
# Define a variable containing a path and you will be able to cd into it regardless of the directory you're in
shopt -s cdable_vars
